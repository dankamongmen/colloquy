Colloquy allows attractive Notcurses widgets to be used from the command line
and shell scripts. It is inspired by `dialog`, a tool based on NCURSES (and
similarly maintained by Thomas E. Dickey), and written in Rust. Colloquy was
originally shipped as part of Notcurses, but pulled out into its own project
during the Notcurses 1.3.0 development cycle.

## Use

* Create a message box, centered on the screen:
`colloquy --msgbox 'Heute Die Welt, Morgens Das Sonnensystem!' 0 0`
